[![Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/kaust-apps/badge/?version=latest)](https://kaust-apps.readthedocs.io)

This repo is meant to deliver easy installation of applications used by KAUST users.
The Formulae included here are built based on [![Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/)].

Research Computing has already setup brew for you in your HOME. This allows you
to install applications when you need them without having to  wait on Research
Computing to compile, test, install it in a shared folder. This is already done
using automated builds. Available packages have already gone through QA.

You can start using brew as described in detail on Linuxbrew pages.
Here's an example on how to install Xcrysden:

    $ brew install xcrysden
